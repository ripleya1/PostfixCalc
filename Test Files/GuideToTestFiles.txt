They are as follows:
Tests 1-3 are postfix expressions of what is found in Tests 7-9. Hence, they produce the same answers:

Test 1/7 ==> 1
Test 2/8 ==> 8
Test 3/9 ==> 85

Tests 4-6 are the same as Tests 7-9, only the parentheses have been removed, resulting in different values
Test 4 ==> 25
Test 5 ==> 4
Test 6 ==> 57
